## Overview and Purpose.
The bus app is a web application that allows admins in charge of bus communication to post information regarding the status of buses for pickup after school. Students can access this information from their phone remotely. The purpose of the app is to make communication easier which makes it easier for admins, makes students less likely to miss their bus or bus changes and allows students to do things after school without fear of missing their bus. 

## Intended Experience
To access the bus app, all users should enter the website url (https://busapp.nnhsse.org/) into a browser. For convenience, it is recommended that users save this website to their phone’s homepage. 

The below lists are the intended experiences for both admins and students:

#### Admin Experience
From the homepage, admins should click the “Login as editor” button in the top right and complete authentication via google on the login page. If they are on the whitelist, they will be redirected to the admin page.  …

#### Student Experience 
On the home page, students have access to all the information they need. The page consists of  a bus table displaying Bus Number, Bus Change, Status and Time. Additionally, a panel displaying the weather is visible in the top right. Students should first check for a bus change when opening the app and then periodically check the status of their bus to make sure they catch it. Information updated by admins is live so students will not have to refresh to view new information.
